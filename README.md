<!-- ![tesear_image](./HumanML3D/dataset_showcase.png) -->

HumanML3D is a 3D human motion-language dataset that originates from a combination of [HumanAct12](https://github.com/EricGuo5513/action-to-motion) and [Amass](https://github.com/EricGuo5513/action-to-motion) dataset. It covers a broad range of human actions such as daily activities (e.g., 'walking', 'jumping'), sports (e.g., 'swimming', 'playing golf'), acrobatics (e.g., 'cartwheel') and artistry (e.g., 'dancing').
