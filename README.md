# <b>HumanML3D: 3D Human Motion-Language Dataset</b>
<!-- ![tesear_image](./HumanML3D/dataset_showcase.png) -->

HumanML3D is a 3D human motion-language dataset that originates from a combination of [HumanAct12](https://github.com/EricGuo5513/action-to-motion) and [Amass](https://github.com/EricGuo5513/action-to-motion) dataset. It covers a broad range of human actions such as daily activities (e.g., 'walking', 'jumping'), sports (e.g., 'swimming', 'playing golf'), acrobatics (e.g., 'cartwheel') and artistry (e.g., 'dancing').

### Statistics
Each motion clip in HumanML3D comes with 3-4 single sentence descriptions annotated on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Motions are downsampled into 20 fps, with each clip lasting from 2 to 10 seconds. 

Overall, HumanML3D dataset consists of **14,616** motions and **44,970** descriptions composed by **5,371** distinct words. The total length of motions amounts to **28.59** hours. The average motion length is **7.1** seconds, while average description length is **12** words.

### Data augmentation

We double the size of HumanML3D dataset by mirroring all motions and properly replacing certain keywords in the descriptions (e.g., 'left'->'right', 'clockwise'->'counterclockwise'). 

### KIT-ML Dataset

[KIT Motion-Language Dataset](https://motion-annotation.humanoids.kit.edu/dataset/) (KIT-ML) is also a related dataset that contains 3,911 motions and 6,278 descriptions. We processed KIT-ML dataset following the same procedures of HumanML3D dataset, and provide the access in this repository. However, if you would like to use KIT-ML dataset, please remember to cite the original paper.

### Data Structure
```sh
<DATA-DIR>
./animations.rar        //Animations of all motion clips in mp4 format.
./new_joint_vecs.rar    //Extracted rotation invariant feature and rotation features vectors from 3d motion positions.
./new_joints.rar        //3d motion positions.
./texts.rar             //Descriptions of motion data.
./Mean.npy              //Mean for all data in new_joint_vecs
./Std.npy               //Standard deviation for all data in new_joint_vecs
./all.txt               //List of names of all data
./train.txt             //List of names of training data
./test.txt              //List of names of testing data
./train_val.txt         //List of names of training and validation data
./val.txt               //List of names of validation data
```
HumanML3D data follows the SMPL skeleton structure with 22 joints. KIT-MLh have 21 skeletal joints. Refer to paraUtils for detailed kinematic chains.

The file named in "MXXXXXX.\*" (e.g., 'M000000.npy') is mirrored from file with correspinding name "XXXXXX.\*" (e.g., '000000.npy'). Text files and motion files follow the same naming protocols, meaning texts in "./texts/XXXXXX.txt"(e.g., '000000.txt') exactly describe the human motions in "./new_joints(or new_joint_vecs)/XXXXXX.npy" (e.g., '000000.npy')

Each text file looks like the following:
```sh
a man kicks something or someone with his left leg.#a/DET man/NOUN kick/VERB something/PRON or/CCONJ someone/PRON with/ADP his/DET left/ADJ leg/NOUN#0.0#0.0
the standing person kicks with their left foot before going back to their original stance.#the/DET stand/VERB person/NOUN kick/VERB with/ADP their/DET left/ADJ foot/NOUN before/ADP go/VERB back/ADV to/ADP their/DET original/ADJ stance/NOUN#0.0#0.0
a man kicks with something or someone with his left leg.#a/DET man/NOUN kick/VERB with/ADP something/PRON or/CCONJ someone/PRON with/ADP his/DET left/ADJ leg/NOUN#0.0#0.0
he is flying kick with his left leg#he/PRON is/AUX fly/VERB kick/NOUN with/ADP his/DET left/ADJ leg/NOUN#0.0#0.0
```
with each line a distint textual annotation, composed of four parts: *original description (lower case)*, *processed sentence*, *start time(s)*, *end time(s)*, that are seperated by *#*.

Since some motions are too complicated to be described, we allow the annotators to describe a sub-part of a given motion if required. In these cases, *start time(s)* and *end time(s)* denotes the motion segments that are annotated. Nonetheless, we observe these only occupy a small proportion of HumanML3D. *start time(s)* and *end time(s)* are set to 0 by default, which means the text is captioning the entire sequence of corresponding motion. 

## Library Requirements
- Python 3
- Numpy          // For motion process and animation
- Scipy          // For motion process
- PyTorch        // For motion process and animation
- Tqdm           // For motion process
- Matplotlib     // For animation
- ffmpeg==4.3.1  // For animation
- Spacy==2.3.4   // For text process

## Process Data

```sh
<!--Pre-processing motions, extracting rotation invariant features and rotation features-->
./motion_process.py
<!--Pre-processing texts-->
./text_process.py
<!--Obtaining the mean and variance of motion data, for the purpose of normalization-->
./cal_mean_variance.py
```

## Animate Data
Recover 3d human motions from rotation features or rotation invariant features, and animate them in 3D.
```sh
./plot_script.py
```
If you are not able to install ffmpeg, you could animate videos in '.gif' instead of '.mp4'. However, generating GIFs usually takes longer time and memory occupation.
